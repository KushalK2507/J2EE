In this we have created the Dynamic Web Project of version 2.6
Now we need to configure the JSP file mapping as it was done for servlet.

Create the Servlet class as Demo first, 
then servlet mapping tag will automatically comes in web.xml file,
Then We have to change some tags in web.xml as below.

<servlet>
		<description></description>
		<display-name>Hello JSP</display-name>
		<servlet-name>Hello JSP</servlet-name>
		<jsp-file>/HelloJSP.jsp</jsp-file>
	</servlet>

	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>Hello JSP</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/HelloJSP</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>
	
	
The above is changes in web.xml
Inside the jsp-file tag the path of of the JSP file is given
which is relative to the Web-Content folder.

Now we will run directly the JSP file. 
And see the URL pattern it would be same as URL pattern in
 servlet mapping in web.xml file.
