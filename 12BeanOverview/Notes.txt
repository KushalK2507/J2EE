JAVA Beans helps us to encapsulate multiple Objects into 1 JAVA Bean and we access
these object using getters and setters

A bean is class which consist of independent multiple properties and these properties are objects

Scope has impact on Availability and Visibility of the bean

Session Scope
If the scope is session in JSP page then it is limited to single session 
i.e. in single browser, If we change the browser then then execute the getProperty.jsp
page then we would get the default value as NULL even if the setProperty is executed.

Application Scope
If we change the scope as application then this bean will be shared across this application.
application scope is the widest scope and in this case only single bean is created and used
within the application.

Page Scope
If we change the scope as page then this will not be reflected in different page.
To see the changes of setProperty then we need to use the getProperty in the same page
to see the changes as the scope is set page all the values will be available to only
to single page.
