JAVA Beans helps us to encapsulate multiple Objects into 1 JAVA Bean and we access
these object using getters and setters

A bean is class which consist of independent multiple properties and 
these properties are objects

A bean is entity class which consist of some properties.

Reading the Data from Bean.
We can directly read the data from the Bean class.
In the id we have complete object for the Bean and we can access the properties from 
the getter and setter OR direclty access the private variable as well.

Scope has impact on Availability and Visibility of the bean

Session Scope
If the scope is session in JSP page then it is limited to single session 
i.e. in single browser, If we change the browser then then execute the getProperty.jsp
page then we would get the default value as NULL even if the setProperty is executed.

Application Scope
If we change the scope as application then this bean will be shared across this application.
application scope is the widest scope and in this case only single bean is created and used
within the application.

Page Scope
If we change the scope as page then this will not be reflected in different page.
To see the changes of setProperty then we need to use the getProperty in the same page
to see the changes as the scope is set page all the values will be available to only
to single page.
In this single bean is created per page.

Request Scope
The request scope is limited to single JSp page. For every JSP page there is separate
request and response object are created per pages.
So if we set scope to request then if we execute the setPropertyRequest.jsp and 
then getPropertyRequest then we would get the default value of setPropertyRequest as Request 
scope is used which limit the scope object to that JSP page only.
To sent the request value from setProperty to getPropery using the Request scope then 
we would use forward and forward the request to getProperty.
