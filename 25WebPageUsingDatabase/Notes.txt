In this we will create the index.jsp and error.jsp and include the header and footer 
JSP page using JSTL core tags

Now for error handling the error-page needs to be configure inside the web.xml file
The tag is as below:
<error-page>
		<error-code>404</error-code>
		<location>/error.jsp</location>
</error-page>

Now if there is anything wrong in the URL then our error page will get loaded.

Now create the servlet in which we create the DatabAse connection.
This would be HomeController and URL pattern would be "/home".

Now we give any random thing in URL then error page would not loaded as all the request 
is handled by our Servlet.

In this we will follow the MVC pattern:
Model class will be our class inside which we will create the Database connection and 
the logic to retrieve the data from DB
Controller class will be our Servlet which will handle all the request
View will be our JSP files.
We will also create the entity class which will be User which will contains the field as that are in DB table
We will also create the context.xml file which is inside META-INF folder.
The content of the context.xml file will be below:
<Context>
	<Resource name="jdbc/project" auth="Container"
		type="javax.sql.DataSource" maxActive="25" maxIdle="5" maxWait="10000"
		username="root" password="root"
		driverClassName="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"
		url="jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/j2ee_db?useSSL=false" />
</Context>


Now we will handle the DB for adding the user through AppController. 
If we have multiple form handled by same Controller and doPost method then we will identify 
it by passing the hidden field from the form.

For listing the user we have ListUsers page
For adding the user we have addUsers page in which form which will be sumntted to AppController post method.
For updating the user we have created the link on listUsers page which is submitting the information to be 
updated to AppController
