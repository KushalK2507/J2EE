Internationalization refers to (i18N).
In internationalization the website supports multiple languages and multiple currencies, in
short multiple locale

LocaleId help us to identify the language and country
To check various locale see --> https://studyeasy.org/general/locale/

LocaleId is used to select the language of the website

To use i18N our website encoding should be UTF and not ISO which is mentioned in top
of JSp page as below:
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"
    pageEncoding="ISO-8859-1"%>
To support i18N, charset=UTF-8 pageEncoding should be UTF-8 

To support the i18N we need to also configure our eclipse which can be below steps:
Window --> General --> WorkSpace --> TypeEncoding in below and select UTF-8

In .properties file if we convert the words to different language it will show 
the unicode of that word which is fine.
The unicode would be present for the language which are not suppoerted like hindi

We will use JSTL formatting taglib for internationalization
fm:message is used to import the tag and the value of the key attribute
 will the label name that we have defined in the .properties file
fm:bundle is used to refer the path of the .properties file and the attribute basename
is used to give the path

If any of the locale file i.e. locale of any property file is not present then it will use
the default locale properties file
