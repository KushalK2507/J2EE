Run Directly HelloWorld.jsp file

Expression element does not support ";", Hence we can writre only single statement
When there is only single line statement we can use Expression element.

If we declare the element inside the expression OR Scriplet then we cannot use access specifier for that variable.
Inside Declaration statement we can make use ACESS SPECIFIER.
Inside the Declaration we can declare the methods. 

We can use JAVA comments inside the Scriplet, 
but for commenting declaration OR Expression elements
 we need to use JSP comments which <%-- xyz --%>
 So always use JSP comments when using JSP Elements
 
 <%@ %> this is the JSP directive element
 JSP Directive are used to provide the meta-data like language,content-type.
