To include the file we have 2 ways : 
1. <%@ %> directive element --> This is used for static content for the file
2. <jsp:include page=""> </jsp:include page=""> --> This is used for dynamic content in file


To import classes in JSP
<%@page import="java.util.Date"%>
This is used only for types in JAVA and would not be able to include whole package as java.util.
