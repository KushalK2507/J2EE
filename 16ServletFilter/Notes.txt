In our previous to restrict the user on the basis of Session we are using in 
Member Area JSP page, so we are having more pages which can be only visited by Member Area
then same logic needs to be implemented on every page, so to overcome this, we can use the 
Servlet Filter.

Now we will create the Servlet Filter, this is is java file which can be created by 
right click on src folder select filter.
The most important method insode filter class is doFilter method.

In older version we can set the filter using web.xml but Servlet 3.0 onwars this can be 
done using annotation @WebFilter

First we will replace the URL pattern with the MemberArea controller URL.
i.e. the URL pattern of MemberController and MemberArea will be same.
Second Typecast the request and response to HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse 
in filter

Now same logic to check the userName and session
and if userName is null then redirecting the page to login page
