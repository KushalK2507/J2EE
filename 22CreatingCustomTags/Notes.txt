we always create the tag file inside the WEB-INF folder.
So create the tag folder inside WEB-INF folder then create JSP tag file.
To create the new JSPtag file create new file search for JSP tag.

Whenever we called this tag inside other JSP file then at that time all the code inside 
this file will get executed.
