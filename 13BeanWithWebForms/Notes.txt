In this we are using the getProperty in form to get the values from the forms in 
setProperty.jsp. and the name should be exactly match with the property defined in the 
Entity class (User.java)

Now in getProperty.jsp, we would simply write below to set all the properties which 
we would get from the form and set to the fields of the bean i.e. entity class.
We should have 1 to 1 mapping between the fields in the form and the entiry and name should
exact match to set the property correctly.

Reason for using Bean
Bean is a encapsulated Data Set of independent property.
It makes easy for developer to send the receive the data easily.
This is usefule for big application when we need to pass the infirmation to multiple page.
