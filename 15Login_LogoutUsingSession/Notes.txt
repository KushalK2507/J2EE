When we invalidate any session any Session then all the Attributes present in that session 
get deleted.

If Cookies are disable then we need to use the encoded URL to get the Context path.
Whenever we are using the request.getContextParth
 then we need to use necodeURL method as below:

 String encodeURL=response.encodeURL(request.getContextPath());
 Now this variable encodeURL would get the value of ContextPath along with SessionID
 So if we use this then in the URL the along with the URL SessionID will alos be printed 
 in the URL
