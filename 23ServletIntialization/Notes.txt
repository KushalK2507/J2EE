In Servlet Initialization we will create the new Servlet and inside this we will make the
URL of this servlet as "/" this means all the request on this website will be served by this
servlet only and while creating the servlet we will also select to create the init method.

init() method is used to initialized the element when we load the Servlet. See Servlet Home.
To load the data using init() is older way.

As new we can use the Annotation to intialize the elements on the load of the Servlet.
We will give the name and value while creating the Servlet in Initilization Paramter
screen which is on the next of after giving the servlet name and on the same window where 
we URL mapping. See Servlet InitServlet


init() method gets hits whenever Servlet is loaded.
service() method gets hits whenever there is a request the service() method gets invoked.
destroy() when we stop the webserver then all the resources gets released.
